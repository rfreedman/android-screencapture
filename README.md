android-screencapture
=====================

A Groovy script to take screenshots of an Android device

This is a Groovy script (without the .groovy extension), set up to run from the Linux / OS X shell.
It uses the ddmlib Android library version r10 via Grape.

The script is very no-frills - it captures the first hardware device that it finds, at the resolution of the device, and writes out a .png file
